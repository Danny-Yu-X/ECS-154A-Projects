These are all the projects I worked on in ECS 154A (Computer Architecture). In this class, I learned an introduction to digital design, interfacing of devices for I/O, and memory management. I also learned about input/output programming via wait loops, hardware interrupts, and calls to operating system services. I now have a fundamental understanding of hardware support for operating system software.
